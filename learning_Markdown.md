# \# Quick and Easy Markdown

Markdownâ€™s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for writing for the web.

## \#\# Why write in Markdown?
- Formatting stays where it should be
- Lightning face to type- no mouse required
- Easy to read when marked-up
- Easy to write 
This was heavily inspired by [this video by Podmedics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A5EpqqDOdk "Youtube link")
You can find more from [podmedics at blog](http://podmedics.heroku.com/blog "To the site")
Another great resource is the [Github Guide: Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
And none of this would be possible without the original creators [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "To the site") and Aaron Swartz.
