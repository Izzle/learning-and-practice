<!--Vim Cheatsheet is a self study tool to learn.. Vim!

    By no means is this meant to be a comprehensive list,
    rather I use it as a point of reference to track which 
    commands I have functionally memorized. Each week my goal
    is to learn between 3-7 new Vim commands or "chunks".

    For a comprehensive guide, you can go to the link below:

    Feel free to copy this technique or learn with me! If you
    have any questions or constructive criticism you can reach
    me on twitter @ron_izzle
