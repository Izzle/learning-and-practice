# learning-and-practice
My personal repository for code I'm creating while learning new languages. This is so I can track my own progress and so I can reference this material in conversation with friends and coworkers.

Fun fact: This repo was created during a 2 hour drive home from LA to San Diego. I tethered wifi from my phone to my laptop while my girlfriend drove - thanks for driving babe!
