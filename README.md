# learning-and-practice
My personal repository for code I'm creating while learning new languages. This is so I can track my own progress and so I can reference this material in conversation with friends and coworkers.

My goal right now is to have fun learning to become a more proficient programmer and work on things that interest me. Once I've found what I'm passionate about, then I can focus more on a career in that field.

- [ ] Brush up on Javascript skills **after Python Padawan trials are passed**
- [ ] Brush up on maths **after Python Padawan trials are passed**
