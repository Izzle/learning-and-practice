# learning-and-practice
My personal repository for code I'm creating while learning new languages. This is so I can track my own progress and so I can reference this material in conversation with friends and coworkers.

My goal right now is to have fun learning to become a more proficient programmer and work on things that interest me. Once I've found what I'm passionate about, then I can focus more on a career in that field.

## Goals

#### Must

- [x] Enjoy what I'm doing
- [x] Practice every day
- [ ] Complete my first project from Projects.pages
- [ ] Use *Django*
- [ ] Use *Beautiful Soup 4*
- [ ] Start using AWS now

#### Should

- [x] Update my readme
- [ ] Learn *intermediate* GIT
- [ ] Brush up on Javascript skills **after Python Padawan trials are passed**
- [ ] Brush up on maths **after Python Padawan trials are passed**

#### Could

- [ ] Contribute **meaningfully** to an open source project
- [ ] Learn *basic* AGILE Development

#### Won't

- [ ] Never stop never stopping

Fun fact: This repo was created during a 2 hour drive home from LA to San Diego. I tethered wifi from my phone to my laptop!
